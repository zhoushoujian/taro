# taro-miXingFeng

This depository follows [miXingFeng app](https://github.com/zhoushoujian/miXingFeng)  to expand weapp mini program and alipay mini program.  

Run 'npm run dev:weapp' to view weapp mini program interface.  

Run 'npm run dev:alipay' to view alipay mini program interface.  

Run 'npm run dev:h5' to view h5 mini program interface.  

Due to some trouble to adjust to react native app, so I have not adjusted it.  


These codes are mainly to use mini program register and login system, mini program websocket and miXingFeng sign system api.

I think this depository can be only as some practice for taro for multi platform about mini program


Some screenshots about three versions show as follows, enjoy!
