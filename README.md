# taro-miXingFeng

This depository follows miXingFeng app to expand weapp mini program and alipay mini program.


Run 'npm run dev:weapp' to view weapp mini program interface.

Run 'npm run dev:alipay' to view alipay mini program interface.

Run 'npm run dev:h5' to view h5 mini program interface.

Due to there are sone trouble to adjust to react native app, so I have not adjusted it.


These codes are mainly to use mini program register and login system, mini program websocket and miXingFeng sign system api. Besides, h5 version have its own login UI.

I think this depository can be only as some practice for taro for multi platform about mini program


Some screenshots about three versions show as follows, enjoy!
